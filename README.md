AMATH 536 project "A study of the mathematical modeling of evolution of advanced adenomas, and the role of aspirin as a chemopreventive and delaying agent for colorectal cancer."

Repositort contains report, and the code for Gillespie simulation algorithm follows the code implemented in Fortran for the paper "Aspirinâ€™s effect on kinetic parameters of cells contributes to its role in reducing incidence of advanced colorectal adenomas, shown by a multiscale computational study," by Yifan Wang, C Richard Boland, Ajay Goel, Dominik Wodarz, Natalia L Komarova

Because of how the code is structured (not as a function but just a loop for now), to get separate arrays, we update different cells after modifying the parameters in the main code.
